# Userscripts
Some userscripts for modifying the behaviour of sites. They need the addon [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (for Firefox) or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) (for Google Chrome) to work.

## Keybr-github
Allows you to practice typing a github repo on www.keybr.com.

Usage:
* Install one of Greasemonkey and Tampermonkey.
* Click [this link](example.com) and press install.
* Press "Import from website" on http://www.keybr.com/#!settings and add the url of the repo. For example "https://github.com/anka-213/userscripts".
* Start typing.

This will pick a random file from the repository. To randomize again, either reload the page or go to settings, and press "done".
